<p>System memory is a scarce resource. When a program needs to be executed, the operating system kernel loads the program instructions (binary) into memory, and initialises the variables by allocating memory space based on the data types defined at compile time. Most operating systems do not provide access for the applications to access physical memory directly. Instead they provide applications with a directly addressable memory space which is virtual (also called virtual memory). Virtual memory allows applications to access more memory than is physically present, and the operating systems achieve this magic by swapping out unused memory segments into disk space and vice versa, giving the illusion of unlimited memory to the various applications. (In reality, virtual memory itself is limited by the addressable space, eg in 32-bit processor, there is 4GB of virtual memory possible.)</p>
<p>A running program is a process. Each process is allocated certain virtual memory by the operating system, and includes the following: program instructions(binary, read-only area), data (static variables initialised by the programmer), <strong>stack</strong> and <strong>heap</strong>. </p>
<p>Stack is a <strong>self-managing memory system</strong> and is used when the memory requirements of variables are known upfront (at compile time) such as for primitive data types (eg integer, char, boolean etc) and for arrays of fixed length. The stack is also used during function invocations. Stack contains a series of frames. A new frame is added when a function is invoked and released when the function completes. Each stack frame contains the variables, function arguments and other relevant information for function to execute. Each thread in a process also gets its own stack. </p>
<p>The stack is very fast and allocates and clears memory by itself. One reason is, stack uses a last-in first-out method where any new memory allocations occur at the top of the stack (and the OS does not have to search the virtual memory to look up free segments to allocate).</p>
<p>The challenge occurs when the OS has to allocate extra memory for dynamic data structures (eg dynamic arrays, variable-length strings, linked lists etc) where the size of the data structure is known only at runtime, and dynamically changes. Such memory allocations are done on the heap, not on the stack. Unlike the stack, heap is not self-managing memory. When memory is allocated , it just sits there until it is manually and explicitly deallocated. To manage this, most high level languages like Java, Python, Ruby, Javascript, C# and Go have a mechanism called garbage collection (GC) which performs automated memory management. This allows the programmer to simply declare a variable when needed, but not worry about the gory details of when and from where memory is de-allocated. Languages like C and C++ are not garbage-collected languages, and the programmer has to take on this manual responsibility, in order to avoid memory leaks, dangling pointers and similar such issues. It is difficult to debug memory-related problems even for experienced programmers. This is why high-level languages use GC. Garbage collection uses its own algorithms to determine which portions of memory need to be deallocated and when. This adds some inefficiencies and also latency to running processes that are serving requests (due to program pauses during garbage collection), but these are not severe for most application-related tasks. This however can become an acute problem while writing systems software and for real-time systems where predictable response measured in nanoseconds is expected. Even though GC is not as efficient as manual-memory management, it significantly improves developer productivity, so high-level languages aimed at writing application software use GC.</p>
<p>Rust adopts a different philosophy for memory management.</p>
<p>It neither expects the developer to do manual memory management (for deallocation) like C/C++, nor does it do automated garbage collection like high-level languages. It uses a third approach where memory management is performed using a set of ownership rules that is enforced by compiler. This is a unique , innovative approach.</p>
<p>Rust uses the following three ownership rules:</p>
<ul>
<li>Each value in Rust has a variable that’s called its owner.</li>
<li>There can only be one owner at a time.</li>
<li>When the owner goes out of scope, the value will be dropped.</li>
</ul>
<p>Let us understand the key concepts of ownership with examples:</p>
<h3><a class="header" href="#scope" id="scope">Scope</a></h3>
<p>In program below, the scope associated with the two variables <strong>x</strong> and <strong>y</strong> is the <em>main ( ) function</em>. At the end of <em>main () function</em>, these two variables go out of scope. The variable <strong>x</strong> is initialized with value <strong>4</strong>, and assigning <strong>x</strong> to <strong>y</strong> <em>copies</em> the value of <strong>x</strong> into <strong>y</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>x</strong> and <strong>y</strong> being of primitive type integer, are stored on the <strong>stack</strong>.</p>
<pre><code>fn main() {
    // Integers copy
    let x = 4;
    let y = x;

    println!(&quot;x and y are {}, {}&quot;, x, y);
} // x and y go out of scope here

</code></pre>
<p>Let us now look at modified version of the previous function this time enclosing variable <strong>y</strong> within curly braces.</p>
<pre><code>fn main() {
    
    let x = 4;
    {
        let y = x; // Integer copy
    } // y goes out of scope here
    println!(&quot;x and y are {}, {}&quot;, x, y);
} // x goes out of scope here

</code></pre>
<p>When the program is compiled , you can see a compiler error stating that <strong>y</strong> cannot be printed as it is not in scope.</p>
<p>When a variable goes out of scope, Rust ensures the memory associated with the variable is released back to pool.</p>
<h3><a class="header" href="#stack-variables-vs-heap-variables" id="stack-variables-vs-heap-variables">Stack variables vs Heap variables</a></h3>
<p>In the previous example, we used integers. Integers are stored on the <strong>stack</strong>. Let us now look at a data type that is stored on the <strong>heap</strong> - <strong>String</strong>. It is stored on the heap because the length of the string is not known at compile-time.</p>
<p>In Rust, assignment of one heap-allocated variable to another involves transferring or moving the value associated with the variable, not copying. In code below, when variable <strong>s1</strong> is assigned to <strong>s2</strong>, the value of <strong>s1</strong> is transferred to <strong>s2</strong>. Hence <strong>s2</strong> owns the value now. So, compiler will throw an error while trying to print <strong>s1</strong>, as <strong>s1</strong> has already moved its value to <strong>s2</strong>.</p>
<pre><code>fn main() {
    let s1 = String::from(&quot;I'm a heap-allocated data&quot;);

    let s2 = s1;

    println!(&quot;S1 is {}, and s2 is {}&quot;, s1, s2);
}
</code></pre>
<p>In Rust, by default, stack-allocated variables are copied and heap-allocated variables are moved.</p>
<p>The question is , why ?</p>
<p>To understand this, we need to take a closer look at two concepts associated with heap-bound values: why copy does not work and how memory deallocation works.</p>
<ol>
<li>When a new string variable s1 is created by the program, a new memory area is allocated for the string data in heap, and only a pointer to it is stored in the stack. When s1 is assigned to another variable s2, the pointer associated with s1 is moved to s2. The actual heap area, where the value is stored , is not touched.</li>
<li>In the hypothetical case where Rust was designed to copy rather than move values during assignment, how would it look? There are two types of copy possible : shallow copy and deep copy.</li>
<li>In shallow copy, only the stack pointer is copied . Both new and old pointers point to same heap address for accessing the value. In this case, when s1 and s2 both go out of scope, program will attempt to release heap area twice, but will fail the second time because both s1 and s2 point to same heap address. This is called the double free problem, where attempt is made to release the same portion of memory twice. So, shallow copy does not align with Rust ownership rules.</li>
<li>In deep copy , both stack pointer and heap value would be duplicated. This would be inefficient use of heap memory. Further, the double free problem applies here as well. So, Rust does not adopt this method.
In summary, both shallow and deep copy would not work for Rust. So, Rust moves value on assignment.</li>
<li>Code below illustrates how Rust avoids the double free issue due to its ownership rules. If in line 4, value of s1 were to be copied to s2 (instead of move), then in line 6, we will encounter the double free issue as the program attempts to release the same heap memory segment twice.</li>
</ol>
<pre><code>fn main() {
    {
    let s1 = String::from(&quot;I'm a heap-allocated data&quot;);

    let s2 = s1;
    // s1 goes out of scope here
    } // here s2 goes out of scope
    
}
</code></pre>
<h3><a class="header" href="#clone" id="clone">Clone</a></h3>
<p>While the default behaviour of Rust is to move values, there may be situations where the programmer wants to explicitly copy heap-values from one variable to another. For such cases, Rust provides a <code>clone()</code> method.</p>
<p>In program below, value of <strong>s1</strong> is cloned and assigned to <strong>s2</strong>. When we print the pointer associated with <strong>s1</strong> and <strong>s2</strong>, you will see that they show two different memory locations, thus confirming that <code>clone()</code> makes a copy of the data at another heap-segment location.</p>
<pre><code>
fn main() {
    let s1 = String::from(&quot;I'm a heap-allocated data&quot;);

    let s2 = s1.clone();

    println!(&quot;S1 is {:p}, and s2 is {:p}&quot;, s1.as_ptr(), s2.as_ptr());
}
</code></pre>
<h3><a class="header" href="#ownership-of-data-in-functions" id="ownership-of-data-in-functions">Ownership of data in Functions</a></h3>
<p>The same rules of ownership that we discussed for local variables is applicable even in case of function parameters.</p>
<p>In the following code, when <strong>s1</strong> is passed to function <code>print_value</code>, its value is moved to the function, and <strong>s1</strong> is no longer available for the <code>println!</code> macro. You will see compiler error here.</p>
<pre><code>fn main() {
    let s1 = String::from(&quot;I'm a heap-allocated data&quot;);

    print_value(s1); // here s1 is moved into function print_value

    println!(&quot;S1 is {}&quot;, s1);
}

fn print_value(val: String) {
    println!(&quot;Printing value {} received&quot;, val);
}

</code></pre>
<p>Another scenario is that when a called function returns a value , the calling function takes ownership of that value, as seen in code below:</p>
<pre><code>fn main() {
    let s1 = String::from(&quot;I'm a heap-allocated data&quot;);
    println!(&quot;S1 pointer is {:p}&quot;, s1.as_ptr());

    let s2 = print_value(s1); // here s1 is moved into function print_value

    println!(&quot;S2 pointer is {:p}&quot;, s2.as_ptr());
}

fn print_value(val: String) -&gt; String {
    val // the value received is returned back from function
}
</code></pre>
<p>Shown below is the output(terminal) of the program. You will see that <strong>s1</strong> and <strong>s2</strong> have the same pointer value associated with them, proving that the stack pointer value of <strong>s1</strong> is moved into the function <code>print_value</code>, and then moved back to <strong>s2</strong> within the <code>main()</code> function.</p>
<pre><code>   Compiling playground v0.0.1 (/playground)

     Running `target/debug/playground`

S1 pointer is 0x55dfc4804a40
S2 pointer is 0x55dfc4804a40
</code></pre>
<p>This in essence is how Rust ownership works.</p>
<p>The key benefits of these ownership rules are to do with twin benefits of memory safety along with fine-grained control over memory which no other programming language is able to provide.</p>
<p>Compared to C/C++, Rust avoids whole classes of memory errors such as double free errors, dangling pointers and memory leaks. In C/C++ avoiding these errors is left to the skills and experience of the programmer , whereas in Rust the compiler has your back, so to speak.</p>
<p>Compared to high-level languages like Java, C#, Python and Javascript, Rust is superior in terms of latency because it avoids the drawbacks associated with garbage collection, while replacing manual memory management with a set of ownership rules.</p>
