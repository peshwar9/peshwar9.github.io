# Navigating Rust - Foreword
This is **YABG (yet another beginners's guide)** to learning the beautiful Rust programming language. 

I've tried to write this in a way I would have liked to learn Rust when I started learning.  

This guide is completely free, no strings attached. I wrote it as a small contribution back to the fabulous and selfless open source community which has given me so much, and to the contributors, thinkers & makers of the beautiful Rust language - thank you so much.

Please send me feedback , issues and suggestions to **prabhu.eshwarla@sudhanvatech.com** or issue a pull request at the [github repo](https://github.com/peshwar9/peshwar9.github.io.git), so I can make the guide better for you.  

**Note:** This guide is work in progress.
